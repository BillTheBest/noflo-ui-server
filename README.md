NoFlo User Interface
====================

This repository provides the web-based user interface for the [NoFlo](http://noflojs.org). NoFlo runs on Node.js and enables you to write and run [flow-based programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming) on the platform.

Currently noflo-ui enables you to visualize existing NoFlo graphs on a web user interface. The long-term plan is to make it possible to create now NoFlo graphs with the same tool, as well as to monitor and modify running NoFlo networks.

Having a proper user interface is NoFlo's [issue number 1](https://github.com/bergie/noflo/issues/1). You can follow the plans and progress also there. The current implementation is based on the [jsPlumb](http://jsplumb.org/) library, but I'm also following the progress on the [dataflow editor](http://meemoo.org/dataflow/).
